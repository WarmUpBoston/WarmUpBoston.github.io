## Testing Locally
To test the site locally, first install (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/] and
(Bundler)[https://bundler.io/]. Then run:

```
bundle install
```

This should generate a Gemfile.lock file.

At this point you should be able to run the site locally by running:


```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
